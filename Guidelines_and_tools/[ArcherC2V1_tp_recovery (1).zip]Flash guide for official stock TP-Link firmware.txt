I also decided to flash OpenWRT a couple of days ago. I tried various options. One firmware worked fine, but the OpenWRT I downloaded from the official website completely killed it. I couldn't even connect via the serial port (I had to solder the connector) – nothing was transmitted over the TX to the terminal.

Looks like I'll have to buy a programmer and flash it directly to the chip.


Well, after reading the posts here, I finally found a solution. If anyone else experiences a bricked router like me after flashing the firmware, where all the indicators simply blink and the router isn't detected in the system, 

I have a ready-made Padavan firmware mod from Linaro. You don't need to do anything with it. Just drop it into the Tftpd64 folder, configure its connection, and flash it.

I installed it on an Archer C2V1, and it works great.
1. Download the firmware zip archive: ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.zip
2. Extract the firmware from the archive - the ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.bin file
3. Copy the firmware bin file to the Tftpd64 folder
4. Configure according to the included instructions, run Tftpd64 as administrator, and flash it.

- Turn off the router

- Connect the cable to the 4th port of the router

- In the properties of the network card, set a static IP: 192.168.0.66, mask: 255.255.255.0

- In the tftpd program, in the settings, check the Use anticipation window of and the value 1000

- In the network card settings in Windows, set 10 half-duplex mode

- Start the TFTP server, select the folder with the firmware 

- Hold down the WPS / Reset button

- Turn on the router (while holding the WPS / Reset button)

- hold the WPS / Reset button until the WPS indicator lights up (~ 10-15 seconds), then you can release the button

- Wait about 5 minutes

- In the properties of the network card, set a dynamic IP (Obtain an IP address automatically)

- Go to the address 192.168.1.1

If you are finding a stable release with Padavan + Linux kernel 3.4.113 with a lots of improvements as described below, read out and you will find out the download link.

+ Common Applications Kept Enhanced (CAKE) scheduler backport
This could be the world's first successful backport of "cake" to the Padavan with Linux kernel 3.4.113.

Taiwan No.1!!!

I believe this is something Dave Täht truly hoped for!!!

The code Dave contributed was always free and open source. 
He turned down numerous lucrative contracts because he always put his principles first – he valued the impact his code could make globally, not just prestige or money.

In memory of Dave Täht (1965–2025), whose work on bufferbloat helped make the Internet measurably better.

PS: Dave is forever in our hearts and souls, in our routers and… in production. https://github.com/LibreQoE/LibreQoS/pull/684 We will miss you so much, Dave.

+ Busybox 1.37.0 with CVE-2025-60876 & CVE-2025-46394 Security Patched

+ Iptables 1.8.11 with Upstream commit Patched

+ Arptables 0.0.5

+ Optimize WebUI for 16:9 wide screen with 1920x1080 resolution.

+ Patch MT7610E Driver (Anti-Disconnect & Fast Reconnect)
(Anti-Disconnect: The original Beacon Timeout is 12 seconds, after Beacon Timeout patch applied, 
it will be 60 seconds. 
Fast Reconnect: Peer Disconnect Logic changed! Fast Reconnect Mode Enabled!)

+ HWNAT binding threshold set to 1.(HWNAT will integrate into your connection faster and significantly reduce CPU load.)

+ HWNAT error fixed and improve the clarity of HWNAT Start Binding and Unbinding Interfaces workflows.

Before my modifications, the displayed IP and port were completely incorrect due to a memory misalignment. 
I also additionally fixed the IP value retrieval logic within the original MTK code, significantly improving the code's stability!

HWNAT error fixed: Show All Foe Invalid Entry, Show All Foe Unbinded Entry, Show All Foe Binded Entry.
Input Command: hw_nat -e hw_nat -f hw_nat -g will print out the correct IP and port infomation now.

Improve the clarity of HWNAT Start Binding and Unbinding Interfaces workflows: For example, you will see the actions what HWNAT done in log.
Below is the transparent process you'll see in the logs, giving you a clear understanding of what HWNAT has done.

1. Download the Attached file "padavan_pack_TPLINK_TL_C2-V1.zip" file (6.64 MB) 

2. Extract the "TL_C2-V1_3.4.3.9L-102-0de6f2f424.bin" file from the archive 

3. Check the hash of the "TL_C2-V1_3.4.3.9L-102-0de6f2f424.bin" file - MD5: ed8002b376c4cfc5c152f01aa3a2f58b 
(In the archive "padavan_pack_TPLINK_TL_C2-V1.zip file (6.64 MB)" have a "md5sum.txt", 
if you need to check hash before updating your firmware, 
you can find out the hash of the "TL_C2-V1_3.4.3.9L-102-0de6f2f424.bin" file in the bottom of the "md5sum.txt".)

4. Go to the router's web interface 
(Find out your IPv4 gateway address and enter the link to the address bar of your browser.)

5. Administration > Firmware update 
(http://192.168.0.1/Advanced_FirmwareUpgrade_Content.asp)
(For example, if "192.168.0.1"is your IPv4 gateway address, you can copy and paste the link above, 
if "192.168.0.1"is "not" your IPv4 gateway address, "http://192.168.0.1" is needed to be change by yourself, 
otherwise you will not receive any responce after you enter the link to the address bar of your browser.)

6. Select the TL_C2-V1_3.4.3.9L-102-0de6f2f424.bin file and click "Upload" button.

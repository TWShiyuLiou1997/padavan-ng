Good evening. If anyone needs it, I offer you an "update" to the Padavan firmware mod from Linaro. Differences from the compiled Merage firmware : Commit: 56960f9 Removed: Design settings (the default theme is active. There are no others.) Added: OpenSSH, OpenSSL, FTP, SFTP Instructions: :)

# 
I have stock
There are two options:
1. Tftpd64 (instructions in the merage post ).
Archive: Attached file ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.zip (6.84 MB)

MD5 hash: D6DC9A7C7F74C22D1BA08156F0B77B20

2. Flashing with a programmer (archive one line above :yes2:)


Warning: Before updating Padavan, change the theme to the default one, otherwise you will have to clear cookies/cache, or the web interface will start constantly refreshing the page. :D
I hope this is useful to someone. ;)

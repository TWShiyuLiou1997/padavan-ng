It's better to put the firmware in the Tftpd64 folder; then you don't need to specify the firmware path (place Tftpd64 in the root of the system drive).
A ready-made Padavan firmware mod from Linaro . You don't need to do anything with it. Just put it in the Tftpd64 folder, configure its connection, and flash it.
I installed it on an Archer c2v1 , and it works great.
Download the firmware zip archive. ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.zip
2 Extract the firmware from the archive - file ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.bin
3 Check the MD5 checksum of the extracted firmware 2ec19d01d28c7a8c0b5fa66bd7fcc0cc
4 Copy the bin file of the firmware to the Tftpd64 folder
5 Configure according to the attached instructions, run Tftpd64 as administrator and flash.
